So many have sacrificed so much over the years to create and preserve this foundational aspect of our government. It is truly a loss when we lose sight of the importance of fulfilling our hard-won civic duty.The Ruth Law Team is all about protecting your rights and helping you to get justice. In order to have that opportunity, we must all share our voice by going to the ballot box on election day. </p>

Support the candidates and ballot measures that can help your community, state, and even the nation for the greater good. Make your voice heard in these elections. Our communities are made up of friends, loved ones, neighbors, and children. Some may not know how important voting is, while others don’t have the privilege. Make the decision to vote for yourself and those around you.  </p>
